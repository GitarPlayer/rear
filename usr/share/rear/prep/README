This is the preparation part of ReaR (i.e. the 'prep' stage)
before starting the rescue/recovery system build phase.

You should not put scripts into this 'prep' stage that modify things
in $ROOTFS_DIR or $VAR_DIR/recovery and $VAR_DIR/layout because
scripts for $ROOTFS_DIR belong to the 'rescue' stage and scripts
for $VAR_DIR/recovery and $VAR_DIR/layout belong to the 'layout' stages.

We have only the real preparation tasks in the 'prep' stage
so that the 'prep' stage can also be run by workflows which
do not make a rescue/recovery system.

Reasoning for ROOTFS_DIR:
Only those workflows that actually make a rescue/recovery system
by running the stages 'rescue', 'build', 'pack', and 'output'
(in particular the workflows mkrescue, mkbackup and mkopalpba)
should modify something in ROOTFS_DIR.
In contrast when other workflows that run the 'prep' stage (e.g. mkbackuponly)
modify something in ROOTFS_DIR then all those modifications will be lost
because no rescue/recovery system with those modifications is made.
So the problem is possible inconsistencies between what gets actually used
during "rear recover" (i.e. the last actually made rescue/recovery system)
versus what other workflows that run the 'prep' stage may need to have.
For example mkbackuponly may need a modified rescue/recovery system
when backup config variables need updated values in the recovery system
(e.g. an updated value for BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE or something similar).
The prep/default/990_verify_empty_rootfs.sh scrip checks at the end
of the 'prep' stage that ROOTFS_DIR is unmodified (i.e. still empty).
